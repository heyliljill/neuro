What I want this data analysis to look like:

1. In ImageJ, open file.
    a. Measure x, y for molecular boundary
    b. Measure x, y for hilus boundary
    c. Measure x, y for each cell
2. Export x, y to matlab
    a. For molecular boundary x, y - polynomial fit (8th order?) ** test which minimizes residual
    b. For hilus boundary x,y - polynomial fit
    c. Calculate shortest line connecting each point and both boundaries
        - Do this by:
        - Initialize by finding shortest path to either one boundary
        - Extend that path to connect to other boundary
        - Calculate total distance
        - Change path to one that is one unit to the left and repeat
        - If distance is shorter, change the shortest total distance and the path
        - Go up to 50 units to left and 50 units to the right
3. Final data should look like:
    Slice | Cell | X coord | Y Coord | boundary1 X,Y coord | boundary2 X,Y coord | total distance | distance to boundary1 |  % distance to boundary1 | activating or no?
    
4. Analyze for % distance to boundary1, and activating or not



New idea for data analysis:
    Divide up each boundary between start point and end point 1000 times or so and find line connect point 1 on boundary a to point 1 on boundary b all the way to point 1000
    Use these as lines and find line that point is nearest to
    Use the nearest point on that line as point to measure distance
    - note: how to deal with end points? may go off image...
